# STATS VALLBLS FROMDATA
## Create value labels for variables from data
 This command creates value labels for selected variables using other variables as the source of the labels.  The variables to label and the label source variables can be listed or selected using patterns in the names.  The labels can be applied directly by this command, but the VALUE LABEL syntax can also be written to a file.
